 StyleBox["\tCentral to the 2006 Ron Howard thriller, \"The Da Vinci Code\" \
is, of course, Leonardo's \"The Last Supper\". The plot of the movie is \
motivated by the idea that Leonardo Da Vinci painted into his masterpiece a \
cryptic and heretical message guarded by a secret society. Although the Da \
Vinci code might be a work of fiction, there may be a seed of truth to the \
myth.\n\t \tMusician Giovanni Maria Pala writes in his book La Musica Caleta \
(The Hidden Music) that Leonardo may have hid into his work a secret hymn \
along with a cryptic message. Pala marked every piece of bread and the hands \
of each of the apostles with a musical note. ",

 "Pala Claims, ",
 StyleBox["\"I marked the pieces of bread on the table and the Apostle's \
hands as music notes. Then I drew a pentagram over the scene between the \
tablecloth and Jesus' face. I couldn't believe my ears when I played the \
music. It sounded really solemn, almost like a requiem.\" The music itself is \
read from right to left (Da Vinci often wrote from right to left as a sort of \
code so that others would not be able to steal his ideas), and when played on \
a pipe organ does indeed sound like a solemn hymn.",
  FontFamily->"Verdana"],
 "\n",
 StyleBox["\tAnother claim that Pala makes in his book is that there exists \
in the painting a hidden Hebrew text. Literally by connecting the dots of the \
\"music notes\" the Hebrew words \"bo nezer usbi\" appeared, which translated \
into English means \"with Him consecration and glory.\" Of course, this seems \
appropriate for the commission.",
  FontFamily->"Verdana"],
 "\n",
 StyleBox["\tAnother claim made about the picture is that of a hidden image. \
Indeed, it seems that there is a chalice hidden in the picture, but not Mary \
Magdalene. \"I placed the nine letters of the ancient Hebrew text one on top \
of the other, following an ascending path, which is the direction of the \
hands of the first six Apostles. The result was a strange image,\" said Pala. \
Noticing that the bread in front of Jesus was split in half, he came to the \
realization that he was to duplicate the image. The resulting image was, \
indeed, a chalice. When rotated around, the motif appeared to be the same \
design as the decorative windows at Maria delle Grazie, where the last supper \
was painted. ",
